### Introduction
This was a 5 day attempt at recreating the SDK functionality for SpacetimeDB inside an Unreal Plugin. 

### Current Status
Barely functional

The framework elements are there for the core of connectivity to SpacetimeDB and Server/Client messages. The connection works and calling for a basic Legacy Subscription is also working but it's only about 50% of the functionality for the core framework. RemoteTables, Reducer/Reducer Events, and message handling are still needed to be built out.
